## FAQ

1. What is the use of method breakpoint?
- It is used to add a breakpoint on the method so that when method is invoked, the program will halt and also
halt when the method is about to exit. This will display all the values of variables from the method.
- Another way to add a method breakpoint is from Run > View Breakpoints.
Add Method breakpoint. Give fully qualified class name. And for method name you can give a method or give a pattern. Eg: get*. 
This will add a breakpoint for all methods starting with get.. in the class.
